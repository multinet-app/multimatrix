# Multinet Node-Link View

## Development Environment
To start a development environment you need to serve the main index.html file from a webserver. The fastest way to do this is with the following code:

```
# Install http-server
$ sudo npm install -g http-server

# Serve the webpage on localhost (default port is 8080)
$ cd src
$ http-server -c-1

```

## Config Files
Config files determine how the visualization is rendered. 

Config files are written in .hjson to allow for comments.
