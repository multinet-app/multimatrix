# Multinet Node-Link View

## Development Environment
To start a development environment you need to serve the main index.html file from a webserver. The fastest way to do this is with the following code:

```
# Install http-server
$ yarn install

# Serve the webpage on localhost (default port is 8082)
$ yarn serve

```
