# Adjacency Matrix View

This is the adjacency matrix data visualization app for the Multinet project. It is a typescript application, written using the Vue.js framework, that allows users to visualize network data hosted on a Multinet instance.

## Quick Start

To get the application up and running in dev mode:

1. Ensure that you have Node and yarn installed.
2. Check out this repository and move into it (e.g., `cd view-adjmatrix`).
3. Copy the `.env.default` file to `.env`: `cp .env.default .env` (or if you prefer, create a symlink: `ln -s .env.default .env`).
4. Install the Yarn dependencies: `yarn install`.
5. Run the application: `yarn serve`.
